# 🌤️🌧️ WeatherApp: Get Real-Time Weather Updates! 🌦️⛅

I'm excited to share my latest project—a RealTimeWeatherApp built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ☀️❄️🌪️

With the help of the Open Weather API, this web application allows you to quickly obtain the weather and geolocation information of any city. Simply enter the city name and press the search button, and voila! You'll receive up-to-date weather details for your desired location. 🌍🔍

But that's not all! The WeatherApp offers an additional feature: it prompts users to utilize their current location. By clicking the "Use Current Location" button, you can access weather information for your present whereabouts. 📍🌍

Imagine the convenience! Whether you're planning a trip or just want to stay informed about the weather conditions, this app has got you covered. No more surprises or getting caught in unexpected weather patterns. ☔⛱️

## Demo
